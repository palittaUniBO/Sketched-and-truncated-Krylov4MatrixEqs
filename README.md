This software is intended to reproduce the numerical experiments illustrated in the manuscript mentioned above.
The software has been developed by using Matlab, version 2022b. 
The function lyap.m of the Matlab Control System Toolbox is required.
Moreover, assembling the coefficients for Example 6.2 needs the Matlab Partial Differential Equation Toolbox.
